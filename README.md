OMG its so sad that no one would update his wikipedia article so he had to do it himself

i need to powerwash my brain thinking about how pathetic that is

its funny too what a miserable and UGLY-ASS human being that just wont go away

my theory is that when he feels like a big fking loser, he edits his own wiki page to get some power back

something happened where he realized, he's a big fking loser
